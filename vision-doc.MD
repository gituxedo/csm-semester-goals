## CSM Vision Doc ##

- ### Pedagogy Goals for JMs
  1. Use Zoom -- popping between breakout rooms, pairing students up, screenshare with annotations, writing on tablet or setting up document cam
  2. Field student questions, including gauging the ``vibe'' of a room online and responding appropriately
  3. SMs observe JMs teaching at least twice throughout the semester -- this includes teaching demos during family meetings or shadowing or SMs watching recordings of class
- ### Interactive Worksheet Goals
  1. Content development -- should they be different from the worksheet? What's the approximate difficulty? Do we want to parse student answers for numerical questions? If so, do we want to randomize any numbers in questions offered + how to calculate the correct answer?
  2. (for now, I think practice.eecs.berkeley.edu is good enough of a UI to imitate. Not sure how to proceed before the above questions are answered -Sylvia)
- ### MT1 Review Session
  1. Lecture style, or barrage of practice problems?
      - Do not want to step on the toes of other SMs if they're making a mock midterm
  2. Can possibly reuse slides from HKN or last semester, but add new problems (even past exam problems are ok)
  1. Make the slides available to others, maybe develop alongside CMs (especially since Austin Lei is also part of this task force)
  3. Divvy up who presents by topic, and have 1-2 mentors monitoring the chat for questions throughout!
      - Issue that came up last semester: TIMING. Some mentors went much faster than others, and students were sometimes scrambling to keep up. Ultimately, we went overtime and cut off roughly half a topic at the end
- ### Worksheet Slides B
  1. Do not cut and paste verbatim from worksheets!! First set up mini-lecture or guiding intuition before diving into problems
  2. Much like the Interactive worksheets, reveal solutions step by step via slide transitions
  3. LaTeX difficulties? Can't "Insert equation" in Google Slides? Alternatives below
      - latex2png.com for google slides (credit @Aishani)
      - Overleaf/Beamer if you're comfortable with LaTeX
      - POWERPOINT allows inserting equations and other media
